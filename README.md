The PathoSpotter project emerged from the desire and enthusiasm of the pathologist Dr. Washington Lu√≠s, from the Oswald Cruz Foundation (Brazil), for improving the clinical-pathological diagnoses for renal diseases. In 2014, Dr. Washington met Dr. Angelo Duarte from the State University of Feira de Santana (Brazil) and both start the building of the project PathoSpotter.  Initially, the project aimed to assist pathologists in the identification of glomerular lesions from kidney biopsies. As the work evolved, the goal shifted to make large-scale correlations of lesions with clinical and historical data of patients and to create a set of tools to aid the pathologists' daily practices.  Currently, the project Pathospotter intends to offer computational tools to:  

 - To facilitate the consensus of clinicians and pathologists, helping to achieve more accurate and faster diagnoses; 
 - To facilitate large-scale clinical-pathological correlations studies; 
 - To help pathologists and students in classifying lesions in kidney biopsies.
